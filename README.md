# ZSH Git Plugin
ZSH Git integration, to display the current working directory and the current working branch.

Use **[alt + p]** to display the whole working path.

## Install

Just copy and paste the snippet in your **`.zshrc`** file. This should be located in your **`$HOME`** directory.

Or clone this repository in your zsh plugin directory (e.g. **`$HOME/.zsh`**). Afterwards, you can add the following line to your **`.zshrc`** file.
```shell
source $HOME/.zsh/zsh-git-plugin.plugin.zsh
```

### For custom styling:
- choose your own *`colors / style`* at the **top**
- add your **icons** inside the **`PROMPT`** string
- edit the **`bindkey`** for your preferred **shortcut**

Or just rewrite everything and use this script as default.

Have fun!
