# ZSH Git Plugin
ZSH Git integration (Plugin), to display branches and working paths.

Use **[alt + p]** to display the whole working path

Just copy and paste the snippet inside your *`.zshrc`* file. This should be located in your **`$HOME`** directory.

---

### For custom styling:
- choose your own *`colors / style`* at the **top**
- add your **icons** inside the **`PROMPT`** string
- edit the **`bindkey`** for your preferred **shortcut**

Or just rewrite everything and use this script as default.

Have fun!
